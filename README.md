# Frostify 🍦

A modern, responsive ice cream website that's actually fun to browse. Built this to practice React and ended up making something I'm pretty happy with.

**Live site:** [frostify.vercel.app](https://ice-cream-iota-peach.vercel.app/)

---

## What's inside

The site's pretty straightforward - browse ice cream flavors, check out deals, and get in touch if you want. Everything's responsive so it looks good whether you're on your phone waiting in line or browsing on desktop.

Main features:
- Clean, mobile-first design
- Flavor gallery with images
- Special offers section
- Contact form
- Some subtle animations to keep things interesting

---

## Built with

- React (because components just make sense)
- Tailwind CSS (honestly saves so much time)
- Vite for fast dev builds
- Hosted on Vercel

---

## Running locally

Want to mess around with it? Here's how:

```bash
# grab the code
git clone https://github.com/Perpetualisi/frostify.git

# jump in
cd frostify

# install dependencies
npm install

# fire it up
npm run dev
```

Then head to `http://localhost:5173` and you're good to go.

## Roadmap (maybe)

Some things I'm thinking about adding:

- Actual e-commerce functionality (would be cool to let people order)
- Search and filter for flavors
- User reviews/ratings
- More interactive animations

No promises on timeline though - this is a side project and I've got other stuff going on.
